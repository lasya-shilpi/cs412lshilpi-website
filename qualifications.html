            I have many years of experience in backend development through my years as a Computer Science Major. Recently, I have been working with front-end development, and I enjoy it. Through my internship, I have also gained a lot of experience with full-stack development and had to stay up to date with many emerging technological developments. I strive to stay up to date on new software development technologies. For example, I read publications on Stack Overflow and watch youtube videos on various new technologies.
            <br></br>
            The programming languages that I am fluent in are C++ and Python. I have experience with SQL, Java, and JavaScript. In school and through my past internship, I got experience with putty, git, bash, WSL, docker, and Kubernetes. Additionally, I want to gain knowledge in languages such as SAP and Hana.
            <br></br>
            Furthermore, I want to further my knowledge in cybersecurity, as I am getting a minor in it. What initially attracted me to cybersecurity is that I never feel like I am doing archaic work. The world of cybersecurity and cybercrime is constantly evolving. Cybersecurity is an important and exciting field, and protecting the world from cyber attacks is interesting. I am continually looking at recent cyber attacks and how companies resolve the issue. 
            <br></br>
            In the future, I want to be a project manager because it's the best way to use my leadership and organizer skills to contribute to a company, which I find very fulfilling. I have always been detail-oriented and methodical. Lists, planners, and spreadsheets have been my academic and professional tools of choice since the fourth grade! I first realized that I had a particular knack for project management while running a volunteering group. I served as a Co-President for a Red Cross club for two years, and in that position, I developed a leadership style based on collaboration and communication.
