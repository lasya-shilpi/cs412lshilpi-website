    <h1 style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%;">About me</h1>
    <p style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%;">Howdy, my name is Lasyasri Shilpi. I am a Computer Science major at Texas A&M University, class of 2024. I am also minoring in cybersecurity, math, and psychology. In high school, I decided to take my first computer science class, my teacher had a niche approach to teaching computer science, and I grew to love it. I would describe myself as a computer science student who is passionate about new programming languages and technologies. I am always looking for new challenges and ways to improve my skills. I enjoy working on projects that are both challenging and rewarding.</p>

    <p>I am a big advocate of inspiring women to join computer science. This ambition led me to join women in engineering organizations within A&M. I joined AWICS(Aggie Women in Computer Science) during my sophomore year and am currently the workshops officer. I schedule workshops and teach students about technical and non-technical information. Some of our technical topics are "Intro to Git" or "Data Structures ."Our non-technical seminars are related to interview preparation. Additionally, I am a part of Vex-U, a robotics team where we are given a challenge each year, and the team has to work together and build two autonomous robots to finish the challenge. The picture on the right is when my team and I won a design award during the state competition. </p>
